# Vancouver Housing Prices (2004-2024) Analysis

This project explores metropolitan Vancouver housing prices over a 20-year period (2004–2024). As a new homeowner and lifelong Vancouverite, this topic is personally meaningful as housing affordability and market trends have become increasingly important both locally and across Canada.

The analysis will focus on the Exploratory-Data-Analysis (EDA) process, including cleaning and transforming raw real estate sales data, generating numerical summaries, exploring statistical patterns, and visualizing long-term price trends using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries).

By the end of this analysis, the goal is to answer:   
  • How have average housing prices in Vancouver changed between 2004 to 2024?  
  • Which neighborhoods have experienced the most significant growth?  
  • What external factors might explain observed trends?  
  
This dataset is a publically available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jennyzzhu/vancouver-house-prices-for-past-20-years).
