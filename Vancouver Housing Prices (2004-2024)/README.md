# Project Overview

This project analyzes Vancouver housing prices over a 20-year period (2004–2024). As a local Vancouverite, this topic is personally meaningful as housing affordability and market trends have recently been a defining issue for our city.

The analysis involves cleaning and transforming raw housing data, exploring key statistical patterns, and visualizing long-term price trends using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn).

By the end of this analysis, the goal is to be able to answer:
