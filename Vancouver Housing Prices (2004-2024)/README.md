# Vancouver Housing Prices (2004-2024) Analysis

This project analyzes metropolitan Vancouver housing prices over a 20-year period (2004–2024). As a new homeowner and local Vancouverite, this topic is personally meaningful as housing affordability and market trends have become hot topics locally and nationally across Canada.

The analysis will focus on the Exploratory-Data-Analysis (EDA) process involving cleaning and transforming raw real estate sales data, creating numerical summaries, exploring statistical patterns, and visualizing long-term price trends using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries).

By the end of this analysis, the goal is to answer:   
  • How have average housing prices in Vancouver changed between 2004 to 2024?  
  • Which neighborhoods have experienced the most significant growth?  
  • What external factors might explain observed trends?  
  
This dataset is a publically available dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jennyzzhu/vancouver-house-prices-for-past-20-years).
