# Data Analytics Portfolio

## Welcome & Overview
Hi, I’m Chris — a data analyst  with a background in project management (PMP-certified) and a passion for turning raw data into actionable insights. With 5 years of professional experience working with data, I enjoy exploring datasets, uncovering trends, and building visualizations that drive decision-making. Outside of my professional life, I enjoy trying different cuisines, watching live sports games, and staying active. 

This repository is created primarily for the purposes of self-learning and hobby and contains a collection of analytics projects focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization. Each project aims to uncover insights and communicate compelling narratives through visualizations. 

My personal goal through these projects is to strengthen and showcase my analytical thinking, technical skills, and storytelling ability.
